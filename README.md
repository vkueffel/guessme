Neustar assignment

Create and host a number guessing game web app.

Using any hosting provider you choose (there are a lot of free options like Google App Engine, or a Micro Amazon instance), create a web based guessing game where the player enters a number from 1-20 and then the computer tells him whether he is right or wrong. The player gets 5 guesses to get it right.

Make sure you include adequate unit test case(s) for the main functionality.
